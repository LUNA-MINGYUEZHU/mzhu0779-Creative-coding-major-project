IDEA 9103 Tut 3 Group C [This is Mingyue Zhu Creative coding major project]
* I added a magnifying glass effect to the group work - As the mouse moves, you can see the effect of enlarging the area of the image.
* The effects I selected are User Input and enlarge the image.
* This enables the user to view the image in detail.
* I learned the magnifying glass technique from the official reference website of p5.js: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3gwnn4H2vA
* I took a look at this effect in action from a video on youtibe: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Image/copy
